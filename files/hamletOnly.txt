  Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
  Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
  Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
  Ham. Saw? who?
  Ham. The King my father?
  Ham. For God's love let me hear!
  Ham. But where was this?
  Ham. Did you not speak to it?
  Ham. 'Tis very strange.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
  Ham. Arm'd, say you?
  Ham. From top to toe?
  Ham. Then saw you not his face?
  Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
  Ham. Pale or red?
  Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
  Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
  Ham. I will watch to-night.
  Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
  Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
  Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
  Ham. What hour now?
  Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
  Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
  Ham. It waves me still.
  Ham. Hold off your hands!
  Ham. My fate cries out
  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
  Ham. I will.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ham. What?
  Ham. O God!
  Ham. Murther?
  Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
  Ham. O my prophetic soul!
  Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
  Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
  Ham. So be it!
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
  Ham. No, you will reveal it.
  Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
  Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
  Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
  Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
  Ham. Nay, but swear't.
  Ham. Upon my sword.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
  Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
  Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
  Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
  Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
  Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
  Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
  Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Ham. Between who?
  Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
  Ham. Into my grave?
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
  Ham. These tedious old fools!
  Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
  Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
  Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
  Ham. Denmark's a prison.
  Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
  Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
  Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
  Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
  Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
  Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
  Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
  Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
  Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
  Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
  Ham. Is't possible?
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
  Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
  Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
  Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
  Ham. Buzz, buzz!
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
  Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
  Ham. Why,
  Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Ham. Why,
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
  Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
  Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
  Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
  Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
  Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
  Ham. No, not I!
  Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
  Ham. Are you fair?
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
  Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
  Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
  Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
  Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
  Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
  Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
  Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
  Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
  Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
  Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
  Ham. What did you enact?
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
  Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
  Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
  Ham. Nothing.
  Ham. Who, I?
  Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
  Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
  Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
  Ham. As woman's love.
  Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
  Ham. If she should break it now!
  Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
  Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
  Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
  Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
  Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
  Ham.   A whole one I!
  Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
  Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
  Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
  Ham. With drink, sir?
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
  Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
  Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
  Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
  Ham. I pray you.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
  Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
  Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
  Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
  Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
  Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
  Ham. What's the matter now?
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
  Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
  Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
  Ham. Such an act
  Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
  Ham. Nay, but to live
  Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
  Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
  Ham. How is it with you, lady?
  Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
  Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
  Ham. Ecstasy?
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
  Ham. I must to England; you know that?
  Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
  Ham. Safely stow'd.
  Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
  Ham. Do not believe it.
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,  
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
  Ham. At supper.
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
  Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
  Ham. For England?
  Ham. Good.  
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
  Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
  Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
  Ham. Who commands them, sir?
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
  Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
  Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
  Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
  Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
  Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
  Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
  Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
  Ham. What woman then?
  Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
  Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
  Ham. How long is that since?
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
  Ham. Why?
  Ham. How came he mad?
  Ham. How strangely?
  Ham. Upon what ground?
  Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
  Ham. Why he more than another?
  Ham. Whose was it?
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Ham. This?
  Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
  Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
  Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
  Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
  Ham. That is Laertes,
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
  Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
  Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
  Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
  Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
  Ham. Hear you, sir!
  Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
  Ham. Up from my cabin,
  Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
  Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
  Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
  Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
  Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
  Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
  Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
  Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
  Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
  Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
  Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
  Ham. What's his weapon?
  Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
  Ham. What call you the carriages?
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
  Ham. How if I answer no?
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Ham. She well instructs me.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
  Ham. I embrace it freely,
  Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
  Ham. No, by this bad.  
  Ham. Very well, my lord.
  Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
  Ham. Come on, sir.
  Ham. One.
  Ham. Judgment!
  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
  Ham. Good madam!
  Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
  Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
  Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.  
  Ham. How does the Queen?
  Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
  Ham. The point envenom'd too?
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
  Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
  Ham. As th'art a man,
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
