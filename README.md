# study_ruby

<h3>The purpose of this project is to show the progress of my development in the <strong>ruby language</strong><h3>

 <ul>
 <li>I will try to study at least one topic every day.🦾</li>
 <li>I'm going to try to do this project completely in English, but I'm sorry if I mix up Portuguese a little🙏</li.
 </ul>

<h4>I'm studying the ruby course of the odin project</h4> link: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby
